Hi,
To start of I am very glad you wrote most of my code for me… Being one of my teams programmers in the FTC tournament, 
I was trying to learn how to use a Gyro sensor and drivers better. I got the segway to stand up tried to create my own 
teleop program for it. I got some issues with the robot not being able to move backward and that it stutters when turning 
left. Here is my code…

#define HiTechnic_Gyro

const tSensors Gyro = S2;
const float your_wheel_diameter = 42;

#include “segway-driver-lv.h”
#include “JoystickDriver.c”

task main()
{
StartTask(balancing);
while(starting_balancing_task){}

while(true)
{
getJoystickSettings(joystick);
{
if(joy1Btn (4) == 1)
{
speed = 50;
}
if(joy1Btn(2) == 1)
{
speed = -50; //Here I am having issues
}
if(joy1Btn(1) == 1)
{
steering = -17; //Here I am having issues

}
if(joy1Btn(3) == 1)
{
steering = 17;
}
else
{
steering = 0;
speed = 0;
}
}
}
}

Hi Roy,

Glad to hear the standard program worked right away. I think you’ll need to add Wait1MSec(20); at the end of the loop.

Presently you’re polling the joystick more often than the Segway code can respond to, so you should not loose performance
in doing this.

Also, you might want to use more Else statements. For instance, you go either backward or forwards, not both at the same 
time. So add the ‘else’ as follows:

if(joy1Btn (4) == 1)
{
speed = 50;
}
else if(joy1Btn(2) == 1)
{
speed = -50; //Here I am having issues
}

The stuttering could be explained by two conflicting commands that you give, such as telling it to go right or left at the
same time.

Let me know if this helps.

Best,

Laurens
