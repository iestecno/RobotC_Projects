  /*Here's how to control the Segway.

  MOVING AROUND
  - Adjust <steering> to steer.
  	   steering = 0  ; //Go Straight
  	   steering = 10 ; //Turn Right
       steering = 17;  //Turn Right quicklier
  	   steering = -10; //Turn Left
       etc...

   - Adjust <speed> for moving forward and backwards.
       Its value is the motor power that the robot will attempt to maintain

  	   speed = 0;     //Stand still
  	   speed = -20 ; //Go backward at 20% of motor power
       speed = 50;   //Go forward at half of maximum motor power (recommended)
       etc...

    - Adjust <acceleration> to change how quickly your robot will reach a certain speed.

       acceleration = 60; means that if your current speed is -20 and you change it
       to 40, it will take 1 seconds to get to that speed. You don't need to change this
       in your program, just set it once. Setting <acceleration = 60;> is recommended.

  TIPS & TRICKS
  - Don't mess with motor B and C!
  - You can read the motor encoders like you would normally do. Just don't reset them.
  - 'speed' sets the segway motor speed - This means you go faster if you use bigger wheels.
  - If you use those big RCX/Motorcycle wheels, say, greater than 60 mm in diameter, consider
    building a slightly bigger Segway, with better supported wheels and a greater wheelspan.
    That improves balancing a great deal!

   //Every 100 ms, we check if the sensor has spotted anything closer than 60 cm.
   //When so, the robot goes backwards, turns, and continues its way. Note how the
   //speed and steering variables are used to manipulate the robot's movement.
